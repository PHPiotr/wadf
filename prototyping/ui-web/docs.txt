To distribute an application onto the staging server, you need to check it into SVN. Convention for the SVN repo is:

[clientname]/[sitename]
which translates into an "app reference" (appref) of clientname-sitename

Then go to 

www.example.com/deploy

and enter:

- SVN revision number
- app reference

Staging will then check out clientname/sitename -r [rev] to /foo/bar/clientname/sitename



Two database servers are available in the office:
- Dev
- Staging
These may run the same version, or the dev one may be newer (e.g. MySQL 5 while Staging is running MySQL 4).

You can access the database servers directly via:

mysql.dev.example.com
mysql.staging.example.com

for *development* purposes.

On the staging server you may also choose to:

- pull a complete named database from dev
- pull an empty database (schema only) from dev
- diff two database schemas
