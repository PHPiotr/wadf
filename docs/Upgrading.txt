Upgrading to v0.9.0+ from any previous version
----------------------------------------------
The main thing to note is that a new option "generated_files_writeable" has been
included and this is set to FALSE by default. Therefore after deployment or 
reprocessing, files generated from ".template" files will not be writeable. This
is to make it harder to accidentally lose work.

Upgrading to v0.8.1 from any previous version
---------------------------------------------
The use of PEAR 1.7.2 is strongly recommended as this has proper support for
handling config files and notifies you when it is not overwriting old files and
thus you need to merge new configs with old configs.

1. Please make sure you use the new wadf.conf in the PEAR cfg_dir (you will need
   to copy it over the old one or diff with the old one and merge changes)

If you use wadf-httpd:

2. Please *delete* ~/.wadf/httpd.conf before running wadf-httpd for the first 
   time after upgrade (to remove the hardcoded port 10080 stuff)

3. Search and replace all instances of '*:10080' with '*' in ~/.wadf/vhosts/*" 
   to remove hardcoded port 10080 references
